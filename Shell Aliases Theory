What is File Descriptor?

In Unix and related computer operating systems, a file descriptor (FD) is an abstract indicator used to access a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network socket. File descriptors form part of the POSIX application programming interface.

Redirection

> - Redirects standard output to a file (Overwrite existing content)

< - Redirects input from a file to a command

Example:

sort < file.txt - this will take the input from the file.txt for the sort command
