Linux Directory Structure Theory
Let's have a theory Lecture First

Here are the Linux Directory Structure (Read Below for each one):



1. / – root

Every single file and directory starts from the root directory.

Only root user has write privilege under this directory.

Please note that /root is root user’s home directory, which is not same as /.

2. /bin – User Binaries

Contains binary executables.

Common linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory.

Commands used by all the users of the system are located here.

For example: ps, ls, ping, grep, cp.

3. /sbin – System Binaries

Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.

But, the linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system aministrator, for system maintenance purpose.

For example: iptables, reboot, fdisk, ifconfig, swapon

4. /etc – Configuration Files

Contains configuration files required by all programs.

This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.

For example: /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/logrotate.conf

5. /dev – Device Files

Contains device files.

These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.

For example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0

6. /proc – Process Information

Contains information about system process.

This is a pseudo filesystem contains information about running process. For example: /proc/{pid} directory contains information about the process with that particular pid.

This is a virtual filesystem with text information about system resources. For example: /proc/uptime

7. /var – Variable Files

var stands for variable files.

Content of the files that are expected to grow can be found under this directory.
